# Oop-bootcamp
## The mission

Those exercises consists of multiple use cases to train myself to use <b>Oop</b>.
They always say that <i>the best way to learn something is to do it</i>, right :smile: ? <br>

## Use Case 1
Here is what I have set up for the first case

First, I created a basket with 3 objects inside it. Then I made a function to calculate the total price and another one to calculate the total tax price.
As you can see, there's 2 folders for use-case 1 :monocle_face: !

Here's why :

In the first folder `use-case1a`<br>
I did the exercise <u>without</u> using `class` as it was ask in the statement.<br>
Now of course, you already guessed what I did in the second folder :drum:<br>
And you are right !<br>
In the second folder `use-case1b` I did the exercise using `class` and that was way easier for me.

## Use Case 2

`use-case2`

For this one I reuse the code of the first case and add a new function that can be used to apply a discount. In this case it can only be used for fruits :banana: :apple:.

## Use Case 3

`use-case3`

Let's forget everything we know about fruits and wine :cry:.<br>
This case is about preparing three types of content for a website :
- Articles
- Ads
- Vacancies

All of those have a title and text. When showing the title, they are modified as follows: articles remain as they are, ads are shown in all caps and vacancies are appended with " - apply now!". The original title should still be retrievable, so no modification is permanent.

Have an array with two articles, one ad and one vacancy. Use this array to show all content types (title + text).

Bonus :gift: an article can be marked as "breaking news". If this is the case, the title is prepended with "BREAKING: ". Extra bonus :gift::gift: display all the content with the appropriate html tags.

## Use Case 4

`use-case 4`

Another whole different exercise :tada:.
There's two groups, both of 10 students. Every student has a name and a grade.
Here's what I've implemented :
- Provide an easy way to calculate the average score of a group.
- Add a function to move a student from one group to another.
- Show the average score of both groups. Move the top student from one group with the lowest scoring student from another. Show the averages again and see how these were affected.
